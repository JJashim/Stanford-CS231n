  - MS-COCO  : Assignment - III.
  - TinyImageNet: Assignment - III.
	    TinyImageNet --> A subset of the ILSVRC-2012 - (*Image downsampled to 64x64 pixels*)

Being a Non-Stanford student and having limited access to the course content; Atlas, It was painstakingly done.   
  It was really worth the effort as it greatly improved my insight about deep learning concepts. 

BTW, As this was done all by myself without any ones aide. I really appreciate if you spot any errors. kindly, let me know :-)
