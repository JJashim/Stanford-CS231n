# Assignment I

This [assignment](http://cs231n.github.io/assignments2016/assignment1/) is all about putting together a simple image classification pipeline, based on the *k-Nearest Neighbor* or the *SVM/Softmax* classifier. 

The goals of this assignment are as follows:

	• understand the basic Image Classification pipeline and the data-driven approach (train/predict stages)
	• understand the train/val/test splits and the use of validation data for hyperparameter tuning.
	• develop proficiency in writing efficient vectorized code with numpy
	• implement and apply a k-Nearest Neighbor (kNN) classifier
	• implement and apply a Multiclass Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier
	• implement and apply a Softmax classifier
	• implement and apply a Two layer neural network classifier
	• understand the differences and tradeoffs between these classifiers
	• get a basic understanding of performance improvements from using higher-level representations than raw
      pixels (e.g. color histograms, Histogram of Gradient (HOG) features)
