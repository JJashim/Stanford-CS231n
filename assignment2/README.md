# Assignment II

This [assignment](http://cs231n.github.io/assignments2016/assignment2/) is about writing  backpropagation. And writing & training Neural Networks and Convolutional Neural Networks.

The goals of this assignment are as follows:

	• understand Neural Networks and how they are arranged in layered architectures
	• understand and be able to implement (vectorized) backpropagation
	• implement various update rules used to optimize Neural Networks
	• implement batch normalization for training deep networks
	• implement dropout to regularize networks
	• effectively cross-validate and find the best hyperparameters for Neural Network architecture
	• understand the architecture of Convolutional Neural Networks and gain experience with training these models on data
