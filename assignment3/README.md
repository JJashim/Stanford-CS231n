# Assignment III

This [assignment](http://cs231n.github.io/assignments2016/assignment3/) is about implementing recurrent networks, and apply them to image captioning on Microsoft COCO. Also, explore different applications of image gradients using a pre-trained model on the TinyImageNet dataset.

The goals of this assignment are as follows:

	• Understand the architecture of recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and how they operate on sequences by sharing weights over time
	• Understand the difference between vanilla RNNs and Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) RNNs
	• Understand how to sample from an RNN at test-time
	• Understand how to combine convolutional neural nets and recurrent nets to implement an image captioning system
	• Understand how a trained convolutional network can be used to compute gradients with respect to the input image
	• Implement and different applications of image gradients, including saliency maps, fooling images, class visualizations, Feature inversion, and DeepDream
